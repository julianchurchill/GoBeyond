
Random strategy should take game history into account when avoiding illegal moves (i.e. Ko)

Dependencies are complicated and entangled  (maybe draw out class diagram)
  - Referee depends on Board and Rules
  - Player depends on Referee, Strategy and Board
  - RandomStrategy relies on Board and Rules
  - Game depends on Referee and Player
  * Referee should be able to provide Board and Rules
  * Player should probably rely on Referee and Strategy
  * RandomStrategy should probably rely on Referee

Player
  - must submit move to referee for their own colour

Packaging - Util (Move, Coord, Board), Engine/Domain {Game, Referee, Player, Rules}, UI { Application }  ?

Game
  - Game scorer... linked to rules for scoring (same Rules object as for verifying moves?), chinese, japanese, computer Go

StrictReferee
  - Referee should check the submitted move is for the current player?
    - Toggle expected player

  - isLegal()
    = super-ko / chinese, japanese
  
Time
  - Where does this belong?
    - Referee/timekeeper to signal game end/change player if time ran out for one player?

GTP
