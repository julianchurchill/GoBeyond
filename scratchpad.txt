
GUI
  - Mouse clicks on SimpleBoardCanvas should be ignored until game is started!
  
Game
  - Moves rejected by Referee should not cause Game to ask next player - keep asking the same
    player until the referee accepts a move... 

GUI
  - Illegal moves should generate a warning for UI player - beep, dialog, screen colouring (red border)?
  - Last move highlight so UI player can see random player has moved
  - Add tick boxes to select random/ui player

StrictReferee
  - Referee should check the submitted move is for the current player?
    - Toggle expected player
    - Why do we need to do this?

Packaging - Util (Move, Coord, Board), Engine/Domain {Game, Referee, Player, Rules}, UI { Application }  ?

Game
  - Game scorer... linked to rules for scoring (same Rules object as for verifying moves?), chinese, japanese, computer Go

Rules
  - isLegal()
    = super-ko / chinese, japanese
  
Time
  - Where does this belong?
    - Referee/timekeeper to signal game end/change player if time ran out for one player?

GTP
  - KGS, NNGS, Computer Go server

Save/Load
  - SGF

Write new Players
  - In new languages?
    - Scala and Clojure both target the JVM, perhaps easy to integrate?
