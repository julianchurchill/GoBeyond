
UI
  - GUI - Swing + TDD?
    - board widget
    - UI player?
      - Use DelegatingPlayer with a GUIMoveSource

Packaging - Util (Move, Coord, Board), Engine/Domain {Game, Referee, Player, Rules}, UI { Application }  ?

Game
  - Game scorer... linked to rules for scoring (same Rules object as for verifying moves?), chinese, japanese, computer Go

StrictReferee
  - Referee should check the submitted move is for the current player?
    - Toggle expected player

Rules
  - isLegal()
    = super-ko / chinese, japanese
  
Time
  - Where does this belong?
    - Referee/timekeeper to signal game end/change player if time ran out for one player?

GTP
  - KGS, NNGS, Computer Go server

Save/Load
  - SGF

Write new Players
  - In new languages?
    - Scala and Clojure both target the JVM, perhaps easy to integrate?
